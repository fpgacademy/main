# Welcome to FPGAcademy

The purpose of FPGAcademy is to provide open-source software tools for teaching and learning digital design using FPGA devices. Most of these tools are intended to be used with Terasic DE-Series boards, which feature Intel#reg# FPGA Devices. These boards are widely used around the world for teaching courses in Digital Logic, Computer Organization, and Embedded Systems. Educational material in the form of tutorials and laboratory exercises for these course using DE-Series boards is available from the [Intel FPGA Academic Program](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/fpga-academic.html). More details showing how the tools provided on FPGAcademy can be leveraged for these courses can be found in the description of each tool.


# DESim

The [DESim tool](https://github.com/fpgacademy/DESim) is an interactive graphical user interface showing features of a DE-Series board, such as switches, lights, and displays. The tool interfaces with the ModelSim simulation software. The simulation results affect the lights and displays in the GUI, as opposed to showing the waveforms corresponding to the signals being simulated.
